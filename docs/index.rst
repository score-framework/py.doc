Welcome to the documentation of SCORE!
**************************************

This is the documentation of the SCORE Framework, which is a product of
strg.at_. It is the core technology, that we use to service `our customers`_.

Since we are experts on all things large-scale media, all our workflows and
tools are optimized for working on very large web projects. The most our
technology stack was confronted with (and handled successfully) was about 8500
requests per second. Here is an excerpt of our customer list for scale:

- oe24.at_ network including wetter.at_ (~31 PI per second on yearly average
  during daytime)
- kurier.at_ and related sites (~18 PI per second on yearly average during
  daytime)
