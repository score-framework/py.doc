Since the framework is designed to be as flexible as possible, the list of
packages you need will heavily depend on your use case. Just make sure you have
a working `python3 installation`_ and know `how to create a virtualenv`_. The
individual SCORE Framework libraries can then be installed using Python's
``pip`` or Node's ``npm``.

Once your development environment is set up, you can head over to the
:ref:`score tutorial <tutorial>`.
