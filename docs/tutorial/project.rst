.. _tutorial_project:

Specification
=============

Our customer, The Ministry of Silly Walks, wants to maintain a blog where
various members, and in some cases external authors, like The Spanish
Inquisition [1]_, are to publish news. Users can access the published blogs and
comment on individual postings.

We will start out with an empty python package and gradually add parts until we
have the desired application.

Let's start with the :ref:`project setup <tutorial_setup>`.


.. [1] You weren't expecting The Spanish Inquisition, were you?
