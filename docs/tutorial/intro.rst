Introduction

The SCORE Framework is founded on the following, smaller parts:

* A set of guidelines on how to write python modules. Every SCORE application
  will need to adhere to these "module guidelines".

* Many, many small libraries built using these guidelines, that form a very
  flexible framework for various use cases.

* Another small python module (called ``score.init``) leveraging the effort put
  into all these modules, which allows the initialization and development of
  SCORE applications with minimal effort.

That's why, in order to understand SCORE, you will need to understand its
:ref:`initialization process <tutorial_initialization>`.
