Introduction

The SCORE Framework is founded on the following, smaller parts:

* A set of guidelines on how to write python modules.

* Many, many small libraries built using these guidelines.

* A python module called *score.init*, that can merge these libraries into a
  custom framework for you.

That's why, in order to understand SCORE, you will need to understand its
:ref:`initialization process <tutorial_initialization>`.
