            Finally, there is a place to read up on the complete history of
            The Ministry of Silly Walks! Although some of the information
            seems to be a bit out of date, we are constantly working to
            provide the most accurate information about our institution:

        title: Signpost to The Ministry removed!
        teaser: >
            A sign post, which was meant to show the way to the delegation of
            The Ministry of Silly Walks was mistakenly removed by Norwegian
            government.
        body: |
            After several months of Norwegian-British collaboration, we had
            finally come to the joint resolution to place signposts to the
            nearest delegation of The Ministry in various Norwegian cities.
            The small city of Ã˜rje was to be first of the many to contain such
            an aid for confused citizens.

            Unfortunately, the results of this joint effort were not
            communicated throughout Norwegian government agencies, which led
            to the removal of said sign post several days later. We are
            concerned, that `this incident`_ might lead to the very end of an
            otherwise very successfull cooperation with the Norwegian
            government.

            We sincerely hope that our `cooperation with Canada`_ is not
            affected by the consequences of this mishap.
